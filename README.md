# XKCD - Reimagined

## This is a project made to learn Next.js in conjunction with NextUI.org

In the course of this project I have learned a lot of things, such as:

* The use of getStaticProps to pre-render a page in build time using the returned props.
* The use of getServerSideProps to pre-render a page on each request using the returned data.
* The use of getStaticPaths to define a list of paths that will be statically generated.
* I learned the concept of server side rendering and made use of it to generate static html.
* I made use of dynamic routes to generate each comic page.
* Implemented the use of NextUI for custom built-in components like Container and Navbar.
* Implemented dark theme using NextUI.
* I made a custom hook to implement translation supporting English and Spanish using I18N.
* Create a custom script to fetch and write each comic locally and use the Image Size library to get the size of each image.
* Implemented search functionality using Algolia search.
